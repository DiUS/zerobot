### Installing Ruby
There are several ways to install ruby

1. Install ruby system wide
2. Use [rb-env](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
3. Use [RVM](https://rvm.io/)

This first option is simpliest when you use just a single version of ruby, but as a Ruby developer
you may need to experiment with different versions of ruby.

Ruby Verions Managers allow multiple versions of ruby to be installed and easy switched between versions
either via ja command or per-project

[rb-env](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is the go due to its simple, unobtrusive approach.
