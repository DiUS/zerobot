### Get a domain name

Assuming your project has a web presence it will one day have a domain name.

In the beginning however, a domain name may not have been chosen or you might
not have access to the DNS records.

Don't let that stop you from getting a __working__ domain name.  They can be
snapped up for as little as $2.

A working domain can be used for:

* Creating well-known endpoints for different environments, QA, Dev, Staging, etc.
* Sharing your magical creation with your stakeholders via a friendly URL.
* Registering accounts with SaaS providers.
* Creating a team presence by providing email accounts and such for members of the team.
* Allow your application to take advantage of DNS

Couple of tips:

* Remember to add domain privacy to prevent someone from discovering personal information such
as name and address.
* SSL certificates can be purchased for approx. $30 per year if a self-signed certificates is
inadequate.
